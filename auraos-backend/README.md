# AuraOS - Backend Core Systems ðŸ§ 

This is the backend server for the AuraOS Architectural Cloud.

**The main `README.md` file in the project's root directory contains the complete full-stack setup instructions. This file provides only the backend-specific context.**

## Local Setup

1.  **Navigate Here:** `cd auraos-backend`
2.  **Install:** `npm install`
3.  **Configure:** Create a `.env` file in this directory with the keys specified in the main `README.md`.
4.  **Launch:** `npm run dev`

To grant your user "Founder" privileges after registering through the UI, run:
`npm run set-owner -- your-email@example.com`

**Leave this server running and return to the main `README.md` for frontend setup.**
